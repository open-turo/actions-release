## Development

### Documentation

We are using [`action-docs`](https://github.com/npalm/action-docs) to keep our action documentation up to date. This is
handled by a script that uses `npx` to run action-lint. To update documentation manually, run:

```shell
pre-commit run -a update-action-readme
```
