# Breaking changes in v5

A minimum version of semantic-release v23 is now required in the `semantic-release` action.

## Upgrade instructions

If you are using a config plugin that doesn't support semantic-release v23 the action might not work as expected. You
can still try to override the semantic version using the `semantic-version` input, but it's not guaranteed to work.
