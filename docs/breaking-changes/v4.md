# Breaking changes in v4

`lint-release-notes` only runs on `pull_request` events.

## Upgrade instructions

When moving to v4, you will need to shift the usage to GHA that are `pull_request` triggers.

This should generally align with shifting the lint-release-notes into the `CI/Lint` step. For
example, [open-turo/actions-jvm/lint](https://github.com/open-turo/actions-jvm/tree/main/lint) now checks for release
notes as well as normal linting.
