# GitHub Action Release Notes Preview

## Description

Github action that generates release notes using semantic-release and posts them as a comment in a pull request with the changes that would be included in the next version of the codebase if the pull request is merged.

## Configuration

### Step1: Set any [Semantic Release Configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration) in your repository.

### Step2: [Add Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repository for the [Semantic Release Authentication](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) Environment Variables.

### Step3: Add a [Workflow File](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) to your repository to create custom automated processes.

## Usage

name: Release notes preview

on:
  # It's import that this runs on the push event, as semantic release will not run on pull_request events
