# GitHub Action Lint Release Notes

## Description

Github action that lints release notes. It generates release notes using semantic-release and posts them as a comment in
a pull request with the changes that would be included in the next version of the codebase if the pull request is
merged. It also will fail if there are breaking changes and no `v<major-version>.md` doc has been created.

## Configuration

### Step1: Set any [Semantic Release Configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration) in your repository.

### Step2: [Add Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repository for the [Semantic Release Authentication](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) Environment Variables.

### Step3: Add a [Workflow File](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) to your repository to create custom automated processes.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Release notes preview

on:
  # It's import that this runs on the push event, as semantic release will not run on pull_request events
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main

jobs:
  lint-release-notes:
    name: Lint release notes
    steps:
      - uses: open-turo/actions-release/lint-release-notes@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
